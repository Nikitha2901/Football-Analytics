### Evaluating players using machine learning with metric as Player Interception Index
Player Interception Index(PII) is the ability of the player to intercept the passes or disrupt the opponent team possession’s. The analysis was done for Manchaster City team.

Please run the script : 

```shell
    python Football_assessment2.ipynb
```
Note : the detailed analysis explaination is there in the code.

## Assumptions made to choose this metric :
- Possession : The first assumption is that possession regain. If a player successfully intercepts and
then passes into next player, this will reduce the opponents play and it gives an opportunity for
Manchester to take over the game.
- Interceptions made in defensive third or final third are more influential to the game than other
zones in the pitch.
- Players awareness,positioning, tactical skills are evaluated by this metric. Higher the interception
rates will reflect the team ’s defensive organization and intelligence.
- This metric is directly related to team success. By regaining possession more often, it will ensure
team can control game flow and create more scoring opportunities.
